Created a Java application for maintaining student records by making use of Singleton design pattern along with the Factory pattern. Performed CRUD operations through JDBC and a MySQL database. Developed the application in such a way that separate controller, service and DAO layers are available for data processing, business logic and database interactions respectively. Focused on proper management of student records such as studentsâ€™ ID, names, age, address and date of birth ensuring the security and confidentiality of data.
